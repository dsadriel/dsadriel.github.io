It helps users track who paid for what, split expenses by shares, and maintain a clear overview of balances to make settling up easy and transparent. The app also includes a shared shopping list to keep everyone aligned on what still needs to be purchased. Built with Flutter and Firebase, Nook416 uses a single codebase to deliver a consistent experience across iOS and Android. This project involved the full product cycle, from problem discovery and UX design to development, testing, and store publication.",
